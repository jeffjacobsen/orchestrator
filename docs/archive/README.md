## Current Documentation

For the current dashboard status and roadmap, see:
- **[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)** - Primary source of truth for all project planning
- **[dashboard/README.md](../../dashboard/README.md)** - Quick start and usage guide
- **[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history and release notes

## Why Archived?

These documents were consolidated into ROADMAP.md on 2025-11-06 to:
1. Maintain a single source of truth for project planning
2. Reduce documentation maintenance overhead
3. Make it easier to track overall project progress
4. Keep the comprehensive technical details for reference

The archived documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding the original design rationale
- Reviewing detailed technical specifications
- Reference during later phase implementations
- Historical context for architectural decisions
